For the next few days:
**Build a Chatbot!**

1) A rather simple one with pure Python (libraries like NLTK or chatbotAI).    
Example: [Chatbot Development with Python NLTK](https://python.gotrained.com/chatbot-development-python-nltk/)

2) A machine learning based chatbot, possibly a seq2seq model.  
Example: [Chatbot Tutorial in PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html)
