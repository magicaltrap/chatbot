The contrast of the screen depends much on the light you put in, but if the light is totally white, the constrast is very good!!! I'm pretty happy with the Nook, even if I cannot purchase directly any book because I don't have US billing address.The only little problem I found when reading for long time, is that because of the outside plastic it gets stuck on the hand and I have to change the position of reading every 15-20 minuts. I suppose once I get the cover I asked, I could handle in another way and the problem won't come back. One very bad experience!! I purchased the cover on Barnes&Noble; and because is going to Europe you cannot track it. The point is that after more than one month it has not arrived yet!! But the worse is that the 2 times I send a mail to B&N; they automatically resent me a mail forwarding me to the help system!!! I finally sent another e-mail to the company external of B&N; that produces the covers for them and I didn't get any answer yet!! So I finally purchased it on Amazon.By the way I also bought a Kindle and it's supposed to arrive in a couple days. I bought it for the textbooks for my studies.Give me some feedback!!!Take care.Xavi\\n      « \\n\\nShow Less\",\n",

Since my last message I have purchased the Kindle 3 as I was concerned about the difficulty of buying and downloading books within the UK. I am so far very happy with the Kindle although I am very interested in what you think of the Nook. I have relatives in the US who are considering buying an e-reader and so I would love to know what your opinion is. If you get the chance to give me some feedback once you've used it that would be great!Thank you.Sincerely,Michelle\",\n",
